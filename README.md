## rest-client
I am Shah Minul Amin. This is my first project written in Go. It was fun to learn a new language and implement a client library.

This rest client library, implemented in Go, accesses the form3 account API provided as Docker container in the file docker-compose.yaml.

Create, Fetch, and Delete operations on the accounts resource have been implemented. List operation is also implemented in addition.

Using docker command `docker-compose up` would run all test cases.

## Future enhancements
* Implement Exponential back-off retry algorithm
